This open submission from [FlexAI](https://www.flex.ai) 
aims to test an [MLPerf inference harness](src), 
designed to evaluate various LLM models from Hugging Face 
using MLPerf Loadgen and vLLM.  It supports benchmarking 
with the [standard MLPerf OpenOrca dataset](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/language/llama2-70b#get-dataset),
varying number of samples, or other compatible datasets from Hugging Face.
